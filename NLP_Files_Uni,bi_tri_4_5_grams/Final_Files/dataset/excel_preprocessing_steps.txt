STEPS TO PREPROCESS DATA IN THE EXCEL SHEET

1. Press Alt + F11
2. Click on 'Insert'
3. Click on 'Module'
4. Copy the code in the 'Sub VBA' file in the dataset folder and paste it in the blank space
5. Click F5
6. Click Enter/Ok

The code in the 'Sub VBA' word file clears all the non-English text from the excel sheet.
It keeps only the capital alphabet and the symbol underscore (_) deleting all the rest.
This lets us keep only the tags to form unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams and calculate their frequencies.
